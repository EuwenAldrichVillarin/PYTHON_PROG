    "Critique\n",
    "    Correctness: The program accurately demonstrates object-oriented principles by defining Dog and DogManager \n",
    "    classes. Each method performs its intended function—adding, removing, searching, and identifying the oldest\n",
    "    dog—correctly and logically. However, it lacks user input for dynamic interaction and does not handle invalid \n",
    "    or duplicate entries, which could cause inconsistencies in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Time and Space Complexity: Adding or removing dogs has O(n) complexity in the worst case since \n",
    "    it may search through the list, while space complexity is O(n) due to storing all dog instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Robustness: The program works as expected for hardcoded examples but could benefit from user \n",
    "    input and input validation. It should include error handling for empty lists, duplicate dog names, \n",
    "    and invalid age or breed entries to prevent logic errors or crashes during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Readability: The structure is clear, with well-defined classes, concise method names, and docstrings \n",
    "    that explain each function. The print statements give useful feedback, and naming conventions make the\n",
    "    program easy to follow and understand.\n",
